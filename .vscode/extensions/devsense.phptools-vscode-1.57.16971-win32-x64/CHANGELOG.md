### Formatting

As requested on [#2195](https://community.devsense.com/d/2195-add-new-blank-line-settings-and-update-psr-12-and-per-styles) we're introducting couple of new format settings:

- `php.format.rules.blankLinesBetweenUseTypes`: Specifies the number of blank lines between different types of `use` statements (e.g., classes, functions, constants). This does not affect blank lines between statements of the same type.
- `php.format.rules.blankLinesAfterOpenTag`: Specifies the number of blank lines to insert after an open tag, except when the closing tag is on the same line.

See [Customize Formatting](https://docs.devsense.com/vscode/editor/customize-formatting/#blanklines) for more details.

### Fix: Default Launch Configuration for Laravel Projects

- The default launch configuration has been fixed to correctly use the Laravel router script. 
- If you don't have a `.vscode/launch.json` file, simply open a `.php` file and press `F5`. The default launch action will start and debug the development web server (assuming you have Xdebug installed).
- Additionally, the initial `launch.json` configuration now contains the correct launch settings for Laravel projects.

> This fix affects using quick built-in development server whenever there is a web root in a subfolder, i.e. having `index.php` in `/public`, `/wwwroot`, or `/webroot`. Now, the built-in development server is started with a working directory same as the web root directory, e.g. `${workspaceFolder}/public`. You can try this if you don't have `.vscode/launch.json` file, and you press `F5` to start debugging.

### Minor Features

- Structured object typed are displayed in tool tips and inlay type hints.
- Improves type inferring, makes better use of `class-string<T>` annotations.

### Fixes

- Running tests from abstract classes [#753](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/753).
- Float and int literals in doc comment [#752](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/752).
- Invalid unnecessary parentheses hint [#750](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/750).
- Mouse hover and completion for expressions in parentheses [#743](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/743).
- Completion after conditional expression.
- Default aliases resolved automatically in `laravel\framework` >= `11.30`.
- Return type of a method resolved from base classes.
- Resolved an issue where the first line inside an `@php` directive in Blade files was indented further to the right each time the file was formatted, under certain formatting rule configurations ([#548](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/548)).
- Fixed an issue where an unwanted space appeared after control flow directives in Blade files during formatting.

## 1.54.16574 (December 23, 2024)

### Code Actions

- Added code actions for class member modifiers order (according to PSR-12) and for missing visibility modifier.

### Improvements

- Structured arrays are simplified in tooltips and hints ([#703](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/703)).
- Better completion and mouse hover after `->` operator, after assignment expression, after `new` without parentheses.

### Fixes

- Completion/Hover/Go To Definition after the new `...(set)` keywords.
- References count for class members referenced through `static::`.
- New `...(set)` modifiers in constructor properties.
- Renaming a global variable shows preview when renaming in another file.
- Doesn't check PSR autoload class name case-sensitively (there are issues with VSCode API and FileSystem API [#635](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/635)).
- Fixes unwanted space after function name in lambda functions [#2196](https://community.devsense.com/d/2196-no-spaces-after-function-name-formatting-rule)
- Navigation in properties with assymetric visibility [#741](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/741).

### Breaking Changes

- The extension does not bundle the old PHPUnit 6 binary anymore. When running PHPUnit tests, user needs to either install "phpunit/phpunit" composer package or specify `"phpunit.phpunit"` setting value.

## 1.54.16480 (December 10, 2024)

### PHP 8.4 Syntax

The editor respects the new PHP 8.4 asymmetric visibility syntax ([#728](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/728)). In case your PHP version does not support it yet, the syntax is underlined as error.

### Profiling Tests &amp; Launch Profiles

Test Explorer allows to Run, Debug, and newly Profile PHPUnit tests (if [PHP Profiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DEVSENSE.profiler-php-vscode) extension is installed). See [Profiling Tests](https://docs.devsense.com/vscode/test-explorer#profiling-tests) for details.

Additionally, [custom `launch.json`](https://docs.devsense.com/vscode/test-explorer#custom-debug-launch-profile) "php" profiles can be used to run tests. 

### Code Actions Have ID

More code actions have been documented (see [Code Actions List](https://docs.devsense.com/en/vscode/code%20actions/list)), so they can be [hidden](https://docs.devsense.com/vscode/code%20actions/hide-code-action) or marked as autofix. [Autofix](https://docs.devsense.com/vscode/code%20actions/autofix) is a neat feature allowing you to implicitly apply useful code actions (when available) on file save or as using "Autofix" command.

### Improvements

- Better suggestion of variable names in syntactically broken file.
- More specific warning message for assigning non-variable by reference.
- PHP manual **Italian** language added. Use command `> PHP Manual Language` or setting `"phpTools.language": "it"`. Note, texts not translated are displayed in English.
- Running PHPUnit tests is faster ([#725](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/725)). Whenever possible, specific file path is passed to PHPUnit so it won't scan everything.
- `"php.executablePath"` setting can be changed in workspace scope settings.
- `"php.executablePath"` and `"php.executables"` can contain variables, i.e. `"${workspaceFolder}/bin/php"`.
- **ORM**: Infers repository class when calling `EntityManager::getRepository(class-string<T>)` using corresponding `#[ORM\Entity(repositoryClass)]` attribute on class `T` ((#2174)[https://community.devsense.com/d/2174]).
- Added code fixes required for WordPress and PER code style.

### Fixes

- Resolved an issue where the `php.format.rules.maxBlankLines` setting was not correctly applied at the end of files. [#2188](https://community.devsense.com/d/2188-maxblanklines-does-not-work-properly-at-the-end-of-a-file)
- Updated the Laravel code style to place the opening brace of anonymous types on a new line, ensuring alignment with Laravel conventions. [#734](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/734)
- Laravel code style removes a space before return type in function declaration [#734](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/734)
- Fixes use of template type arguments in a derived class declared in a `/vendor/` folder (e.g. ORM's `EntityManager::getReference()`).

## 1.53.16379 (November 19, 2024)

### Code Actions Settings

**Code Actions Severity** can be changed now. It means certain refactorings or suggested quick fixes can be either hidden or marked as a warnings or error. 

To hide a code action, use either:

- the corresponding quick fix "Do not show"
- or add the code action to `"php.problems.exclude"` VSCode setting.
- or add the code action to your `.editorconfig` file.

To change its severity, add the code action to your `.editorconfig` file. The following sample marks all the redundant closing tags `?>` as errors, forcing you to clean it up:

For details, see:

- [Set Code Action Severity](https://docs.devsense.com/en/vscode/code%20actions/severity)
- [Hide Code Action](https://docs.devsense.com/en/vscode/code%20actions/hide-code-action)

```ini
[*.php]
php_remove_redundant_closing_tag = error
```

**Code Action Autofix**: a code action can run as auto-fix now. See [Auto-fix](https://docs.devsense.com/en/vscode/code%20actions/autofix) for details.

### Diagnostics

- New diagnostic checking invalid use of `instanceof` with a trait on right side.

### Fixes

- Indexing meta files in `vendor` folder.
- Indexing symlinked packages in `vendor` pointing outside the VSCode Workspace ([#684](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/684)).
- Fixed deleting text after cursor ([#638](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/638)).

## 1.53.16338 (November 12, 2024)

### Formatting

We’re excited to announce the introduction of a new **PER** code style option in our extension, aligned with the [PHP-FIG PER coding style standard](https://www.php-fig.org/per/coding-style/). This coding style is designed to help PHP developers maintain consistent, high-quality code that follows the latest industry standards. By using **PER**, you ensure your project’s code adheres to a standardized format, enhancing readability, maintainability, and collaboration with other developers.

![PER code style](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/settings-codestyle-per.png)

To apply this style, simply set `"php.format.codestyle"` setting to `"per"` in your configuration settings, and the formatting adjustments will be automatically applied to your project. This new option is a great way to streamline code formatting and ensure alignment with the **PER** guidelines across your PHP codebase. Happy coding!

### Code Actions

The [Sort Uses Code Action](https://blog.devsense.com/2023/sort-uses-and-remove-unused-uses-on-php-file-save) is a powerful tool that can be applied in several contexts: as a code action, during auto-import, and in conjunction with the `editor.codeActionsOnSave` setting. This feature allows developers to automatically organize their `use` statements in a consistent order, making the code cleaner and more readable.

To further customize the behavior of this feature, you can control its case sensitivity. The setting **`"php.sortUses.caseSensitive"`** lets you specify whether sorting should take case sensitivity into account. Set this option to `true` for case-sensitive sorting, or `false` for case-insensitive sorting. By default, sorting is **not case sensitive**, so all `use` statements will be ordered without distinguishing between uppercase and lowercase letters. 

For more details, check out the related discussion [#2127](https://community.devsense.com/d/2127) on our community forum.

### Diagnostics

- Added diagnostic for using invalid class name, i.e. a reserved class name.

### Fixes

- Copilot chat window does not break IntelliSense and code diagnostics; after closing changes suggested by Copilot chat are ignored.
- Fixed finding references between methods in class and traits used by this class.
- Fixed indexing composer packages symlinked outside the project folder.
- Fixed language server crash when class is named 'parent' or any other reserved keyword.

- **New code action** to change fully qualified function name to an alias ([#693](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/693)).
- **New setting `php.format.exclude`**. This allows to specify one or more glob patterns for files that won't get formatted using PHP formatter. This includes `formatOnType`, format document, `formatOnSave`, and format selection. Also when using the new `Format Multiple Files` command, excluded files will be implicitly unchecked during the final format review.

### Improvements

- Default language level changed to 8.3.
- Inlay hints with named parameters can be inserted on double-click only when labguage level is set to PHP 8.0 or greater ([#686](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/686)).

    - `"source.source.sortAndRemoveImports"`: removes unused uses and sorts the rest.
- Recognizes unsealed array shape type ([#587](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/587))
- Blade respects short open tags.

### IntelliSense

- Laravel's `Macroable::macro()` gets better `$this` inferrence inside nested lambda function.
- `@param` completion with missing parameter names.

### Hints (`...`)

Code with an available quick refactoring is annotated using three small dots. There is a mouse tooltip with more details and a quick fix which performs the corresponding code action.

![Quick Fix Hints](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/vsc-hint-quickfix.gif)

The formatter now provides `Align Properties` functionality to align the properties within class definitions for improved code presentation and readability. Activate this feature using the `php.format.rules.alignProperties` option.

```php
class X
{
    var       $a   = 1;
    public    $bb  = 2;
    protected $ccc = 3;
}
```

### Features

- Inline suggestion after `namespace`.
- Folding blade blocks.
- Completion for blade tags.
- `.blade.php` files formatting (must be opened as a PHP file).

### Blade Formatting

The blade (`.blade.php` files) code formatting has been implemented. The formatter combines HTML/CSS/JS and PHP pretty print and PHP indentation, together with blade blocks indentation.

There are no further settings (yet). Based on your feedback, we'll be adding more settings and fixes!

![Blade Formatting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/vsc-blade-format.gif)

> Note, if you have another Blade extension, this feature might not be available. Make sure, the language of opened `.blade.php` file is set to `PHP` (the lower right corner of your VSCode window).

### HTML Auto Closing Tags and Attributes

In PHP code, HTML tag elements now close automatically when you type the `>` of the opening tag. Similarly, when you enter the `/` of the closing tag, a matching closing tag is inserted seamlessly.

Additionally, HTML attribute quotes are now automatically included when you type `=`.

### Auto Renaming HTML Tags

Auto-renaming HTML tags is enabled by default now. You can disable this feature using the following setting in your VSCode's `settings.json`:

```json
"[php]": {
    "editor.linkedEditing": false
}
```

```php
function foo() {}
```

Additionally, we've included support for the wrapping option `always`, ensuring that the appropriate syntax construct is always wrapped.

### Fixes

- Fixed semantic highlighting in `.blade.php` files.
- Updating problems after adding/removing `"php.stubs"`, or adding/removing `ext-**` in `composer.json`'s `require`.

- Stability fixes.

## 1.43.14858 (January 24, 2024)

### Unnecessary Parentheses

Parentheses that can be safely removed are dimmed in the code now, and a corresponding code fix "Remove unnecessary parentheses" is available.

### Improvements

- Type inferring for generic arguments inferred from lambda return type.
- Formatter handles `@formatter:off` and `@formatter:on` directives in comments.

### Formatting

Based on user's feedback [#395](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/395), we've added a new code style for Joomla developers! To enable it set `"php.format.codeStyle"` setting to `"joomla"`.

![$_SERVER items completion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/vsc-server-var-completion.gif)

### Code Completion for Array Keys

Array keys are listed and completed as possible. This works great with structured array doc comments (e.g. `array{name:string,id:int}`) and array initializers (e.g. `new ['name' => "John, 'id' => 1]`).

### Code Actions and Refactorings

- Code Action to generate getter/setter for a constructor property.
- Code Action to simplify `isset(A) ? A : B`.

### Improvements

- Doc Block with multiline `array<>` syntax supported.
- Doc Block with `@psalm-type` definition using `=` character supported.
- Doc Block with `@var` defining a type of a whole expression (not just a variable) is handled.
- Type analysis improved in case there is a lot of array types with key names.
- Type analysis handles complex L-value of `instanceof` operator.
- Type analysis improved in case there are a lot of array types with key names.
- Type analysis for `??` operator improved.
- Improves handling global variables in WordPress source code.
- Code completion for array keys, type inferring for array entries, and trigering completion after `[`.
- Inlay hint for variables by reference (`&`) and expressions type won't be inserted on double-clicking.
- PHP language level respects `composer.json` if no specific `php.version` is set.

### Formatting

- Added the ability to specify the placement of the semicolon on a new line when method chaining wrapping applies.

### Debug

We've added `maxConnections` launch setting to control the maximum number of simultaneous debug sessions. [#353](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/353)

### Fixes

- Fix of unexpected whitespace after `do` in method name [#1871](https://community.devsense.com/d/1871-unexpected-white-space-after-function-name)

## 1.42.14434 (December 12, 2023)

### PHP Stubs UI

Adding a quick command `> Workspace Stubs` which popups quick selection of stubs (PHP books and other stubs including `"WordPress"`) to be available to IntelliSense and Code Analysis.

![PHP Stubs UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/vsc-php-stubs-ui.png)

### `"source.fixAll"` Action

Safe quick fixes, such as simplifying a name, can be auto-fixed on file save. Use the following settings to apply safe quick fixes on file save:

```json
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll": true,
    "source.organizeImports": true
}
```

### Debug

#### Breakpoint Resolution

Improved breakpoint resolution by validating breakpoint locations through information from Xdebug. Notably:

- Bound breakpoints are highlighted in red.
- Unbound breakpoints are visually distinguished in grey.
- In cases where a valid location close to the breakpoint couldn't be bound, the breakpoint is automatically adjusted to the valid location.

#### xdebug_notify Support:

Added support for `xdebug_notify()`, enabling the sending of information and objects to the debug console. This feature enhances the debugging experience by facilitating the communication of relevant data directly to the console.

#### Error and Warnings

We've implemented the output of PHP warnings and errors to the debug console.  This approach provides a centralized location for developers to monitor and address issues during debugging sessions.

### Improvements

- **Quick Fix** for missing function `use`.
- Added **`php.stubs`** for `newrelic`.
- Implicitly includes **PHP stubs** from `composer.json` into IntelliSense and Code Analysis.
- **More complex PHP executable**: This allows using a remote `php`, or a custom command to run `php`. Settings `php.executablePath` or `php.executables` can have a command with arguments (i.e. `ddev exec php`). **NOTE:** double-quotes might be needed now.
- **PHPUnit path can be absolute**: Put the setting `phpunit.phpunit` into double-quotes to keep the path to your custom phpunit as it is, i.e. `"phpunit.phpunit": "\"phpunit\""`.
- **PHPUnit command can be customized**: Using new setting `phpunit.command` you can customize the command to run PHPUnit etirely. Use variables for customize the command:
    - `${cwd}`: workspace root path, local. The command will be executed in this directory.
    - `${phpunit}`": path to phpunit binary. It's automatically resolved or it can be cutomized with `phpunit.phpunit` setting.
    - `${phpunitxml}`: path to the phpunit.xml relative to the workspace root.
    - `${phpunitargs}`: constructed PHPUnit arguments. (we need --teamcity and --filter to function properly)
    - `${phpargs}`: optional arguments to PHP which we use to ensure PHP runs and debugs correctly.


### Formatting

In response to feedback from you ([source](https://community.devsense.com/d/1792-turn-off-codelens/8)) we've implemented two additional options aimed at enhancing code formatting flexibility:

#### Keep Functions on a Single Line

Introducing the `php.format.rules.keepFunctionsOnOneLine`` option, which allows users to instruct the formatter to refrain from wrapping functions or methods if they are on a single line. This empowers developers to maintain a concise and consistent coding style.

#### Keep Classes on a Single Line

With the new `php.format.rules.keepClassesOnOneLine`` option, you now have the ability to prevent the formatter from wrapping classes when they are on a single line. This feature supports the preservation of a streamlined and compact structure in your codebase.

### Fixes

- Code Action to sort and remove `use`s fixed, when in a global namespace.
- Improves resolution of methods returning `static`/`$this` ([#1820](https://community.devsense.com/d/1820)).
- Inlay hints position fixed, when editing code near them.
- Fixed Go To Source in Test Explorer.
- Rename refactoring shows _Preview_ when change might be dangerous.
- Rename refactoring handles constructor properties propertly ([#450](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/450)).
- Various code analysis improvements.
- Workarounds for various `_ide_helper.php` bugs.
- Fix of conditional breakpoints. Previous version broke this feature in certain cases.
- Fix code action to implement interface with `static` functions ([#446](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/446)).
- Fix of incorrect formatting in nested associative array with multiple functions ([#432](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/432)).
- Fix for the `invalid or missing options` warning when starting a debugger with an older Xdebug version [#1816](https://community.devsense.com/d/1816-all-in-one-php-support)

### Premium

- Note: _Code Actions_, and _Code Fixes_ are available in [PREMIUM](https://www.devsense.com/en/purchase). It may have worked unintentionally without a license before this update.

## 1.41.14263 (November 14, 2023)

### Formatting Improvements

#### Comments

In this update, we've made improvements to how comments are handled. Now, comments that follow after an expression are preserved in their original positions, giving users the flexibility to indent them as they prefer.

```php
$x = [
  1  => 'one'      // first comment
  42 => 'fortytwo' // second comment
]
```

#### Align match arm bodies

The formatter now offers "Align Match Arm Bodies" to align the bodies (results) within `match` expressions for enhanced code clarity and structure. Enable this feature with `php.format.rules.alignMatchArmBodies` option.

```php
match ($day) {
    'Monday'    => 'Work',
    'Tuesday'   => 'Tacos',
    'Wednesday' => 'Waffles'
};
```

### Doc Comments and Type Annotations

- **Structured `object` Type**: dynamic objects can be annotated within doc comment using `object{property:type,}` syntax.

- **Global `@type` Aliases**: type aliases can be defined in the scope of the entire file using doc comment `@type`, `@phpstan-type`, `@phpstan-import-type`, `@psalm-type`, `@psalm-import-type`. Previously, it only worked above classes and functions. Now it is also valid in a doc comment `/** */` anywhere in the global file scope.

- **Code Actions** for qualified names in doc comments ([#428](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/428))

- **@method** syntax with modifiers is supported, i.e. `@method public static foo()`. This is an unusual syntax, although we do understand it now.

### `redis` Stubs Added

`"redis"` can be added to your `"php.stubs"` VSCode setting. This adds type checking and IntelliSense for using the `redis` extension.

### Diagnostics in Rename Preview

When renaming a symbol **with preview** (`F2`, `Shift+Enter`), newly the preview window gets analyzed and errors and warnings are underlined.

### Debug

#### Random Xdebug Port

As of now, specifying `"port": 0` in your `launch.json` is treated as a random available port. `php` is started automatically with the corresponding `xdebug.port = ${port}` directive. By default, the port is already chosen randomly if you don't specify anything. Most of **Run &amp; Debug** commands simply work now.

The sample launch configuration, which starts _Built-In Web Server_, initiates debugging, and opens the browser:

```json
{
    "name": "Launch Built-in server",
    "type": "php",
    "request": "launch",
    "runtimeArgs": ["-S", "localhost:8888", "-t", "public"],
    "port": 0,
    "serverReadyAction": {
        "action": "openExternally"
    }
}
```

You can also omit `"port": 0,` completely since it is a default value for this launch configuration.

> Note, default ports when just _listening for Xdebug_ are still `[9003, 9000]`.

> More at: https://docs.devsense.com/en/vscode/debug/launch-json#built-in-php-server

Quick launch commands (pressing `F5` without having `launch.json`) uses random available Xdebug port as well. There is nothing you need to do.

#### Expression Evaluation Enhancement

Now, expressions can be expanded into deeper levels in various contexts, including the Debug Console and Watch Window. Enjoy enhanced debugging with improved evaluation results.

#### Run/Debug current PHP File

Now, you can run or debug the currently opened PHP file with quick Run/Debug buttons in the top right corner of the editor.

New **PHP 8.3** syntax is supported by the formatter.

### Final New Lines

By default, the formatter will no longer trim final new lines. Final new lines will be preserved as they are. However, if you have `files.insertFinalNewline` enabled and a final new line is missing, the formatter will automatically add one for you.

### Fixes

- Fixed installation on **code-server** and GitHub CodeSpaces.
- Fixed `vendor` folder with recursive symlinks ([#1720](https://community.devsense.com/d/1720)).
- False named argument error in case the method accepts variadic arguments ([#1722](https://community.devsense.com/d/1722)).

## 1.39.13943 (September 20, 2023)

### Class Name Inline Suggestion

Newly, when typing a new class, the class name is suggested based on the file name. The suggestion takes advantage of the Visual Studio Code's inline completion UI, so it's non disruptive; accepted with `TAB` key.

![PHP class name suggestion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/vsc-complete-class-name.gif)

In combination with [IntelliPHP](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DEVSENSE.intelli-php-vscode), the inline code suggestions are even more detailed and powerful!

### Completing File Paths

Since this update, the editor is completing and navigating to files [#402](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/402).

![file path suggestion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/vsc-complete-filenames.gif)

### Fixes

- Old-style `composer/installed.json` file supported.
- Fixes some formatting issues that occurred when mixing PHP with HTML.

## 1.38.13918 (September 15, 2023)

### Setting for Getter/Setter Naming Convention

Added setting for naming convention of generated getters and setters.

![set naming convention](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/getterSetterNaming.png)

### PHP 8.3 Syntax

Adding support for **PHP 8.3** syntax features including:

- Typed class constants
- Anonymous readonly classes
- Dynamic class constant fetch

### Formatting

In response to user feedback([#384](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/384), [#1691](https://community.devsense.com/d/1691-array-trailing-commas), [#684](https://community.devsense.com/d/684-code-format-array-last-item-comma)), we have introduced additional formatting options that allow users to precisely control the automatic placement of commas in their PHP code.

These new options include:
 - `php.format.rules.addCommaAfterLastArrayElement`: Adds a comma after the last element in an array.
 - `php.format.rules.addCommaAfterLastCallParameter`: Adds a comma after the last parameter in a function call.
 - `php.format.rules.addCommaAfterLastDeclParameter`: Adds a comma after the last declared parameter in a function or method signature.

In addition to the above, we've also introduced the following formatting options:
 - `php.format.rules.booleanConstantCasing`: Defines casing for `true` and `false` constants.
 - `php.format.rules.nullConstantCasing`: Defines casing for `null` constants.

### Fixes

- debugger handles file paths with `%` character [#380](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/380)
- caching /vendor/ fixes
- problems gets updated after composer updates
- memory use optimizations
- avoids showing keyword tooltip if it's not a keyword
- avoids showing duplicit items in peek window
- When using Drupal code style, the formatter changes all True/False/Null constants to upper case. [#870](https://community.devsense.com/d/870-drupal-code-style-doesn-t-do-uppercasing-true-false-null)
- When multiple changes to settings changes for formatting or inlay hints were performed at once, only the first change was considered; subsequent changes were ignored.
- Resolved formatting issue related to the PSR-12 coding standard for multi-line argument lists. The closing parenthesis and opening brace are now correctly placed together on their own line with one space between them, in accordance with the PSR-12 standard.
- More fixes of code diagnostics and IntelliSense.
- Array initializer values are now formatted with an additional level of indentation. [#935](https://community.devsense.com/d/935-format-indent-array-initializers-values)

## 1.38.13779 (September 1, 2023)

### Fixes

- sticky scroll [#387](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/387)
- tooltip for `default` case [#1692](https://community.devsense.com/d/1692)
- tooltip for attributes
- fixes type analysis of parameters without type specified
- fixes problems analysis setting
- caching of /vendor/ fixes
- fixes use of `static` in /vendor/ files [#389](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/389)
- fixes temporary cache incorrectly created in the workspace [X/1697612088196137243](https://twitter.com/driesvints/status/1697612088196137243)

## 1.38.13759 (August 30, 2023)

### Optimized Loading and Memory Use

With this update, we're starting to cache `composer.lock` with `vendor` folder. This significantly improves opening workspaces based on Composer packages, and drops the RAM usage to bare minimum.

_For our insiders_, see your `OUTPUT` / `PHP Language Server` panel for what it's doing.

### Inlay Hints for Attributes

Newly, attributes above classes will have inlay hints with parameter names ([#383](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/383)), if enabled.

### `scalar_objects` Support

Thanks to the suggestions [#378](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/378), we're adding native support for the [`scalar_objects`](https://github.com/nikic/scalar_objects) extension by Nikita Popov.

The editor recognizes `register_primitive_type_handler()` calls, and allows completion for specified scalar types.

### Formatting

In direct response to [user request](https://community.devsense.com/d/1656-line-up-on-consecutive-constants) we've added formatting options to align constants `php.format.rules.alignConstants` and enum cases `php.format.rules.alignEnumCases`. Maintaining consistent alignment is now effortless:

```php
class X {
    const a   = 1;
    const bb  = 2;
    const ccc = 3;
}
```

### Code Analysis in Virtual Files

We have enabled full code analysis for files that are virtual - i.e. diff views, peeks, git preview, etc. This allows to analyse for changes you're about to submit easily!

![analyse virtual document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/vsc-analysis-virtual-document.png)

### Outline with Symbol Details

Thanks to the suggestion [#109](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/109), we have added more details to the document outline. It shows methods access, class access, and `interface`, `trait`, `enum` kinds.

![Symbol outline with details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/outline-with-details.png)

### Fixes

- Fixes lag when closing VS Code or a Workspace.
- Fixes `use` statements sorting.
- Fixes go-to-def of a method defined in a `trait`.
- Fixes `@psalm-import-type` phpdoc tag support.
- Fixes inlay hints when there is a `new` without parameters.
- Fixes rename refactoring of static methods.
- Optimizations.
- Fixes formatting issues that occurs when using reserved words in namespaces, such as default

## 1.37.13534 (August 4, 2023)

### Completion Namespace Label

Newly, the code completion shows namespaces next to class names. This feature is **enabled** by default, and can be controlled with `"php.completion.showNamespaceLabel"` setting.

![completion namespace label and colored tool tips](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/color-completion-and-namespace-label.png)

### Completion Colored Details

The code completions popup is formatted and colorized as well.

### IntelliSense

- Class name completion in single-quoted strings has been added.

### Fixes

- Fixed infinite RAM usage ([#343](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/343#issuecomment-1664221959))
- Fixed array not automatically aligned [#364](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/364)
- Duplicit warnings have been fixed.
- When Folding HTML tags, the closing tag stays visible. [#363](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/363)
- Fixed removing spaces for variadic arguments [#1639-2](https://community.devsense.com/d/1639-wrongly-detected-problems-for-constructor-arguments/2)
- Resolved multiple issues pertaining to the nesting and combination of HTML tags with PHP tags. [#1634](https://community.devsense.com/d/1634-indentation-problems-with-auto-format-in-vs-code)

## 1.36.13417 (July 1, 2023)

### Debugger &amp; `trigger` Setting

New launch setting `"trigger"` allows to control whether to debug or ignore certain requests.

```json
{
    "name": "Debug built-in server",
    "type": "php",
    "request": "launch",
    "runtimeArgs": [
        "-S",
        "localhost:8000",
        "-t",
        "./public"
    ],
    "trigger": "THIS",
},
```

The `launch.json` setting above will start the built-in Web Server, configure all the Xdebug directives, and waits for requests. Only requests with the `GET` parameter `XDEBUG_TRIGGER=THIS` will be debugged. Any other request will be ignored by the debugger. I.e. request to `http://localhost?XDEBUG_TRIGGER=THIS` will initiate debugging, but `http://localhost` will not.

### IntelliSense &amp; `IteratorIterator`

`IteratorIterator` and `RecursiveIteratorIterator` are extended with generic type argument `TInner`, `@mixin TInner`, and their `__construct()` infers this `TInner`. Therefore, IntelliSense knows the inner iterator type and so it can provide inner iterator's members. ([#1613](https://community.devsense.com/d/1613))

### New IntelliSense Features

- `@phpstan-type` and `@phpstan-import-type` are supported ([#1543](https://community.devsense.com/d/1543-local-type-aliases)).
- `phpstan.neon` (and `.dist` alternatives) in containing directories processed; supporting their global type aliases (`phpstan.neon` file's [`"typeAliases"`](https://phpstan.org/writing-php-code/phpdoc-types#global-type-aliases) setting).
- Handling `Collection<TValue>`, `Iterator<TInner>` correctly.
- Undefined properties accessed with magic `__get()` reported with lower severity.
- Fixes trait adaptation and class inheritance analysis. Classes with complex inheritance with trait `use` with adaptation are analysed correctly giving unseful insights about missing method implementation.
- Fixes control-flow analysis of certain `try`/`finally` blocks.
- Improves Laravel IntelliSense.

### Namespace Auto-Import

There is already namespace auto-import feature, which seamlessly adds correspding `use` or fully-qualifies names when using code completion. There are also code actions where you can choose a new namespace to import. Additionally we're adding commands `Import class ...` and `Fqn class ...` to import a namespace using command bar (`F1`) and quick-pick window ([#450](https://community.devsense.com/d/450)).

### Stability Fixes

- Memory leak when having `.phar` files in the solution has been fixed.

## 1.35.13327 (June 20, 2023)

### Organize Uses

The action known as _Organize Imports_ can be invoked anywhere in source code now ([#349](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/349)). Removing and Sorting `use` statements affects the entire block of code, not just a single line.

### Composer

Path to `composer.phar` can be set explicitly using the setting `composer.bin`. Also, resolving `composer.phar` has been improved so it mostly uses your own already installed composer. Otherwise, if user does not have composer installed, it gets downloaded and used seamlessly, witnout the need of doing anything.

### Refactoring

Trait function members are resolved in semantic highlighting, finding references, code lenses with method overrides, and rename refactoring.

### Debugger &amp; Phar

The extension parses and understands `.phar` files. Since this updated, debugging and stepping through a code inside a `.phar` file works. Phar file is decoded, opened, and current statement highlighted as it would be a regular `.php` file. Local variables can be also inspected and inline debug values works as well.

### Stability

This update fixes an issue related to the process not being terminated when `code` gets closed.

## 1.34.13295 (June 15, 2023)

### IntelliSense &amp; `@phpstan-type` and `@psalm-type`

Since now, we have a basic support for local type aliasing.

### IntelliSense &amp; Traits with Generics

Newly, `trait` use can be annotated with `@use` doc comment to specify the trait's generic arguments ([#840](https://community.devsense.com/d/840-generics-allow-template-for-trait-usages)), i.e.:

```php
class MyClass {
    /** @use MyTrait<int, string> */
    use MyTrait;
}
```

### IntelliSense &amp; `static` Type

We have reimplemented the internals and improved type analysis for various cases involving use of `static` and `$this` within traits, protected properties, and class inheritance in general. Moreover generic arguments and trait members are resolved better with more inherited type information ([#931](https://community.devsense.com/d/931-inherit-and-static-array-type/)).

### PHPUnit Tests &amp; Continuous Run

Newly it is possible to run tests continuously. The *watch* icon in *Testing* panel allows to keep all the tests, test suites, or just specific test cases always up-to-date. ([#1479](https://community.devsense.com/d/1479-autorun-test-suite-on-file-save))

### Minor Improvements

- Code completion of named arguments completes the `:` at the end. ([#1600](https://community.devsense.com/d/1600-improved-autocomplete))
- Code completion of hinted array keys within single quotes. ([#1600](https://community.devsense.com/d/1600-improved-autocomplete))
- Completion triggered after typing SPACE after `instanceof` keyword.

### Fixes

- Fixed a few memory leaks!
- `match`, `fn`, and `interface` are not reported as syntax errors when within a qualified name (PHP 8.0+).
- PHP 8.2 standalone `true`, `false`, and `null` type names. ([#338](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/338))
- Fixed a few type inferring cases.
- Fixed reporting functions annotated with `@ignore` tag as unknown.
- Type hinting through `/** @var */` above `if` fixed.
- Fixed check of `define()`. ([#340](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/340))
- Fixed issue causing removal of new lines when formatting after abstract method. [#1525](https://community.devsense.com/d/1525-formatting-issue)
- Arrow functions now respect php.format.rules.spaceWithinDeclParens to add spaces within parentheses. [#1536](https://community.devsense.com/d/1536-space-within-fn-parenthesis)
- Fixed unwanted space when function is named as keyword [#335](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/335)
- Do not increase indentation if previous sibling node ends on the same line [#333](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/333)
- Fix of array items aliging when keys are not simple literals [#1602](https://community.devsense.com/d/1602-auto-format-woes)

## 1.34.13120 (May 5, 2023)

### IntelliSense

#### Trait Adaptation Blocks

Code completion and tool-tips in `trait` adaptation blocks have been implemented. ([#582](https://community.devsense.com/d/582))

#### Other Improvements

- Type inferring in the context of `is_a()` analyzed correctly.
- Less falsy warnings for non-static methods called statically in case there is `__callStatic()` magic method.
- New quick refactorings through code actions.
- Updated integrated PHP manual and localizations.

### Add Missing PHPDoc

The `Add Missing PHPDoc` code action inserts the doc comment as a snippet ([#157(comment)](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/157#issuecomment-1512313864)). This replaces template variables and allows you to type into placeholders.

### Formatting

We've added an option that enables you to turn formatting on or off within a specified range of code. The code between a comment `// @php-format off` or `/* @php-format off */` and a corresponding comment `// @php-format on` or `/* @php-format on */` will not be formatted. 

Additionally, We've added a new option `php.format.rules.declKeepRightParenAndOpenBraceOnOneLine` which will keep the right closing parenthesis `)` of a function or method declaration header on the one line as opening brace of the body `{`.

The other options that allows for more formatting customizations include:
 - `php.format.rules.openBraceOnNewLineForNamespaces` which place open brace `{` on a new line for namespace declarations.
 - `php.format.rules.openBraceOnNewLineForBlocks` which place open brace `{` on a new line for all types of code blocks, except for those controlled by other formatting rules.
 - `php.format.rules.spaceBeforeParenthesesInControlStatements` which insert a space before parentheses in control statements.
 - `php.format.rules.spaceBeforeParenthesesInCalls` which insert a space before parentheses in method, function and constructor call parentheses.
 - `php.format.rules.spaceBeforeParenthesesInDeclarations` which insert a space before parentheses in method, function and constructor declaration parentheses.

### Inlay Hints

 We've added an option to show return type inlay hint only for named functions, not for anonymous functions and arrow functions ([#326](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/326)).

### Fixes

- Respecting `class_alias()` within type checks and type inferrence checks.
- Respecting `@return $this` and treating it as `static` return type hint.
- Respecting `"php.completion.autoimport-docblock"` setting when generating **PHPDoc** above functions ([#896](https://community.devsense.com/d/896)).
- `"mongodb"` stub updated and fixed some missing MongoDB classes and functions. Use setting `"php.stubs": {"*", "mongodb"}` to use it ([#927](https://community.devsense.com/d/927)).
- Find All References performs type analysis if necessary to provide better results ([#322](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/322))
- Fixed use of named parameters of methods introduced with PHPDoc `@method` tag ([#921](https://community.devsense.com/d/921)).
- Properly handling the nullable `?static` type.
- Code diagnostics improvements, avoids a few falsy warnings.
- Fixes internal error when completing user snippets.
- When multiline php code was present inside javascript string, formatting wasn't working correctly [#908](https://community.devsense.com/d/908-tab-stop-indentation-with-open-curly-braces/5)
- Fix of incorrect indentation when named arguments were used in multi-line static function calls.
- Fix of unwanted compacting of new lines when multiple foreach colon blocks were used. [#893-12](https://community.devsense.com/d/893-another-formatting-issue/12)
- Fix of incorrect indentation of named arguments in certain cases [#928](https://community.devsense.com/d/928-wrong-formatting-of-named-arguments)
- Fix of incorrect indent of pseudo class constant [#932](https://community.devsense.com/d/932-formatting-issue)
- Fix of formatting when php was inside script/style tags. [#1460](https://community.devsense.com/d/1460-codeigniter-4)
- Fix of lossing indentation in multiline comments delimited with `/*` [#1489](https://community.devsense.com/d/1489-code-formatting-issue-in-visual-studio-code-using-php-tools/3)
- Fix of formatting removing empty lines in `/*` comments [#1522](https://community.devsense.com/d/1522-comment-block-issue)
- Fix of incorrect indent in multiple nested multiline lambda functions[#1500](https://community.devsense.com/d/1500-formating-issue)

## 1.33.12934 (April 8, 2023)

### IntelliSense

Supporting `.phpstorm.meta.php` with `expectedArgments()` and `argumentsSet()` now.

![expectedarguments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/meta-expectedarguments.png)

### Fixes

- Formatting was compacting whitespaces after arrow or lambda functions ([#913](https://community.devsense.com/d/913-after-update-formatting-deletes-empty-lines-and-moves-curly-braces-up)).
- Internal exception fix when navigating to definition ("Go To Definition" command).
- Crash fix for rare cases in huge files in Drupal.
- Added the missing `static` keyword in code completion in function body.
- IntelliSense/Code analysis handling `iterable<K,T>` (with 2 generic arguments) the same as PHPStan does ([#914](https://community.devsense.com/d/914-generic-of-traverable/2)).

## 1.33.12924 (April 05, 2023)

### Test Explorer

The _Test Explorer_ looks and watches for any _PHPUnit_ XML configuration file matching glob pattern `**/phpunit*.xml` or `**/phpunit.xml.dist` (outside the `vendor` folder) [#313](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/313). This allows having **multiple configuration files** in the same directory with custom names.

![multiple phpunit configurations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/test-multiple-configs.png)

Additionally, we have fixed:

- Executing all tests within a configuration file.
- Executing all tests within a single test suite.
- Correct Xdebug directives so it won't cause unnecessary warnings when debugging tests.

### ParaTest

This update allows running [ParaTest](https://github.com/paratestphp/paratest) in the same way as PHPUnit tests. To do so:

- Install ParaTest composer package using the command `Composer: require dev package`, and search package `brianium/paratest`.
- Update your workspace settings:
  ```json
  {
    "phpunit.phpunit": "./vendor/bin/paratest"
  }
  ```
- Navigate to _Testing_ panel and run or debug your tests.

### Sort Uses on Save

The following setting works for sorting and organizing `use` statements on save:

```json
{
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": { "source.organizeImports": true },
}
```

### IntelliSense

Now it's possible to `Ctrl`+`Click` (or go to with `F12`) on `@inheritdoc` to navigate to base Doc Comment directly. [#897](https://community.devsense.com/d/897-jump-to-phpdoc-via-clicking-on-inheritdoc)

Additionally, return type hint in signature help is respecting template (generic) arguments.

### Composer `"composer.workingPath"` Setting

Thanks to the feedback [#909](https://community.devsense.com/d/909-setup-a-working-directory-for-composer), we've added setting `"composer.workingPath"` where users can specify the relative path for the `composer.json` and `vendor` folders.

### Fixes

- Memory leak happening when updating/removing `.phar` files in the workspace fixed. (happens usually on `composer update` and `require`.) [#291](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/291)
- Not auto-completing parentheses `()` after `array`, `require`/`include`, `exit`, and `die`.
- If a multiline HTML attribute was enclosed in single quotes and located within a PHP blocks, it would be indented during every formatting session. [882](https://community.devsense.com/d/882-one-more-auto-format-creeper) 
- Fixed rare case when mixed html/php formatting resulted stopped the formatter. [887-B](https://community.devsense.com/d/887-cannot-format-code-with-syntax-errors)

## 1.32.12895 (March 28, 2023)

### IntelliSense

- `null` specified as Doc Comment `@param` type is reported as invalid.
- `true` pseudo-type correctly handled within union types.
- Methods named `new()` are handled correctly in mouse hover and code completion.
- Detecting Laravel services improved.
- Initial implementation for `expectedArguments()` PHPStorm meta.
- Completing `declare` and `declare(strict_types=1);` after `<?php` tag.

### Refactoring

- PHPDoc `@see` and `@uses` is recognized during rename refactoring, find all references, and highlight occurrences.
- Unused `use` check works even if **problems** setting is turned off.
- **Namespace import** for any simple class name. We have code action suggestions to import a namespace or fully qualify the class name if there are more classes with the same name.

#### Organize Imports

We have added support for VS Code's **"organize imports"** command and eventual `"editor.codeActionsOnSave"` setting allowing you to _organize imports_ (aka **remove unused uses**) when saving documents automatically.

![organize uses](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/source.organizeimports.png)

## 1.31.12740 (March 4, 2023)

### Inlay Hints

Newly **Inlay Hints** for PHP code are available!

![inlay hints](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/vsc-inlay-hints.png)

The inlays are available for parameter names, by-reference arguments, and inferred function return types.

![inlay hints](https://docs.devsense.com/content_docs/vscode/imgs/vsc-inlay-parameter-byref.png)

To enable or disable the inlay hints, change the following **settings**:

- `"editor.inlayHints.enabled"`
- `"php.inlayHints.parameters.enabled"`
- `"php.inlayHints.parameters.byReference"`
- `"php.inlayHints.types.return"`
- `"php.inlayHints.types.variable"`

See [the documentation](https://docs.devsense.com/vscode/editor/inlay-hints) for more details.

### Quick Fix for missing Doc Comments

New code action adds missing doc comments with inferred type information and summary placeholders. The functionality is the same as by typing `/**` above a function/class/property/constant or `define()` call, but it can be invoked through a code action and it can be invoked over a whole selection of code for multiple declarations at once. ([#226](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/226))

### Smart Select

Visual Studio Code's selection range feature allows to quickly select syntactic elements; the PHP extension provides selection range for all the statements, declarations, and blocks of code.

### Formatting

Another feature request we received quite often was to introduce `Drupal` code style [#795](https://community.devsense.com/d/795-add-drupal-code-style-to-list). So we're happy to announce `Drupal` code style has been introduced in this version.

Formatter respects `files.InsertFinalNewLine` option now. [#837](https://community.devsense.com/d/837-formatter-removes-a-new-line-after-a-class-closing-brace)

### Fixes

- Fixes "Search TODO" command if there are remote:// or git:// files in the workspace, possibly after using git merge, or diff window.
- Fixes indexing directories inside `.git` and other special directories when changed.
- Types specified in Doc Comments can be `$this` keyword as an alias to `self`, i.e. `callable($this)` ([#843](https://community.devsense.com/d/843-error-in-parameter-type-with-docblock)).

### Formatting Fixes

## 1.30.12484 (February 10, 2023)

### Fixes

- Code Formatter fixes.
- Fixes various standard functions missing, and missing ambiguities.
- Homebrew `php` recognized on macOS.
- Fixed formatting of heredoc with interpolated variables [#820](https://community.devsense.com/d/820-heredoc-with-interpolated-variables-breaks-auto-formatting-for-the-entire-file)

## 1.30.12450 (February 9, 2023)

### Editor

**Folding `use`** has been added; this allows to collapse the block of `use` statements ([tweet](https://twitter.com/JoelPiccoli/status/1622633203818176512)).

### Getter/Setter

Newly, code inserted by adding getters and setters can be customized using settings `"php.completion.getterSnippet"` and `"php.completion.setterSnippet"`. In this way, you can add various value handling and customize return values, or add comments for yourself ([#813](https://community.devsense.com/d/813-setter-without-self-reference)), i.e.:

```json
"php.completion.setterSnippet": "{PROPERTY} = sanitize(${NAME}) ?? throw new InvalidArgumentException('Invalid ${NAME}!');\n//done\nreturn {THIS};",
```

### Formatting

 - Backed enumerations are supported.
 - New setting `php.format.rules.keepControlStatementsInOneLine`. [#810](https://community.devsense.com/d/810-is-there-an-option-to-not-auto-indent-one-liners)
 - Setting `php.format.rules.SpaceBeforeColonInControlflowStatements` renamed to `php.format.rules.SpaceBeforeColonInControlStatements`.
 - Fixed unwanted space in type declaration [#271](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/271)
 - `php.format.rules.alignConsecutiveAssignments` now aligns only assignment if they directly follow each other. Inserting a new line between assignments will force them to align differently.

 ### Fixes

 - Documents opened in diff view won't appear twice in symbol searches and symbol navigations ([#549](https://community.devsense.com/d/549-intellisense-remembers-old-method-parameters/11)).
 - Fixes symlinks recursion on Unix ([#269](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/269)).
 - Fixes blank What's New screen.

## 1.30.12417 (February 7, 2023)

### Doc Comments

Supporting literals and constants inside Doc Comments (i.e. inside `key-of<>` and `value-of<>`), so the type information in Doc Comment is parsed and IntelliSense works inside it ([#801](https://community.devsense.com/d/801-key-of-and-value-of-support)).

### Diagnostics

- Duplicate promoted property reported.
- Reports modifying read-only properties.
- Reports use of undefined property if there is `__get`/`__set` but also `@property` doc comment declaration.
- Added diagnostic for unknown attribute class.

### Rename Refactoring

Renaming a `class`, `interface`, `trait`, or `enum` suggests to rename the corresponding file as well, if appliable.

### Hover Tool-Tips

Newly, there are two more settings to configure the hover tool-tip.

- `"php.hover.fullname"` adds the full class member name at the top of tooltip (including the fully qualified name of the class) (disabled by default) ([#808](https://community.devsense.com/d/808-show-class-name-in-function-description-on-hover-popup)).
- `"php.hover.containingClass"` lets you to enable/disable showing class name as a part of a function tool-tip (enabled by default).

### Fixes

- Overall workspace processing time (source code parsing) has been optimized.
- Added missing `ZipArchive::` constants ([#256](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/256)).
- Constants defined inside lambda functions are shown in IntelliSense, and code diagnostics ([#257](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/257)).
- Rename refactoring and semantic highlighting of constructor promoted properties.
- Context-aware completion after `extends`/`implements` keywords.
- Fixes `"Problems: Exclude Git Ignore"` in case there are many `.gitignore` files in the workspace.
- Fixes use of `@global` type defined above function declaration.
- Fixes generating Doc Comment upon `/**` above trailing comma ([#265](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/265))
- Fixes updating problems and code analysis when using `includePath` overlapping the workspace path(s).

## 1.29.12304 (January 29, 2023)

### IntelliSense Improvements

**Respecting `@internal` annotation**

Symbols annotated with `@internal` doc comment tag are hidden in the completion list now;

**Correct ordering**

We have updated how the code completion is ordered depending on context and so-far typed text; Symbols from imported namespaces are listed first, then top-level symbols, and at the end there are symbols that can be auto-imported.

**Deprecated classes**

Additionally, deprecated classes and interfaces are striked-out in the code completion list, and when used in the source code. Previously, we did that only for functions.

![deprecated classes and interfaces](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/vscode-deprecated-types.png)

**Performance**

More frequent operations have been moved to a background thread to make the user experience fluent and uninterrupted.

### Short Open Tags `<?`

We have enabled parsing of PHP code inside short open tags (`<?`) by default. It handles the case where `<?xml` is at the beginning of the source code; 

Parsing inside short open tags can be disabled using the setting `"php.workspace.shortOpenTag"`.

### Composer

The local development version of `composer.phar` is updated automatically every 30 days.

### Fixes

- Missing `pcntl` constants added to IntelliSense.
- Fixed `#region`/`#endregion` collapsing.
- Fixed collapsing in various situations.
- Fixed update of IntelliSense after `composer update`.
- Fixed incorrect `integer` type name shown in tool-tips.
- Fixed renaming of global variables ([#242](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/242))
- Fixed warning message on non-en localizations ([#249](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/249)).
- Fixed missing unreachable code warning in `switch` statement.
- Fixed missing `Exception` class in the completion right after `throw new`.
- Fixed auto-import when there is a syntax error ([#671](https://community.devsense.com/d/671)).
- Formatter does not remove space after `yield from` ([#248](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/248)).
- `use` with leading `/` stopped the formatter.
- Colon block ending with `;` separated with whitespaces from colon block closing token stopped the formatter.

## 1.28.12200 (January 21, 2023)

### New Code Actions

More useful refactorings are coming to the PHP extension and VS Code. Following are refactorings introducing common PHP 8 syntax to your code.

**Condition `?:` can be replaced with `?->`**

Simplifying conditional expressions like the one below:

![simplify conditional expression](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/vsc-code-action-conditional.gif)

**Assignments can be simplified**

Simplifying assignments:

![simplify assignment expression](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/vsc-code-action-assignment.gif)

**Converting `switch` to `match`**

In certain cases, `switch` statement can be converted to the new `match` expression.

### PHPStan Conditional Return Types

This update adds support for the new PHPStan's Conditional return types. Return types specified in this way are properly recognized now, colored accordingly right in the source code, and the IntelliSense uses the specified types correspondingly.

![phpstan conditional return types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/phpdoc-phpstan-confitional-return.png)

### Improved Type Checks and IntelliSense

**BREAKING:** By default, we're now reporting diagnostics _inside opened documents only_. This can be changed using setting `"php.problems.scope"`. The exception is the syntax errors - those are reported from across the whole workspace.

In addition, various _falsy_ warnings have been fixed, mostly in combination with generic types. The type analysis have been improved in general.

Also, most of polyfills are not messing up with codecompletion and symbol navigation; Since built-in manual is annotated with generic type arguments, it is preferred over the polyfills from 3rd party packages ([#241](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/241)).

### Improved Completion Ordering

The code completion itself has been improved, so _local_ symbols should be listed first. We're still working on this feature, and improving as much as possible.

### Fixes

- We have fixed a memory leak, and the language server crash.
- Fixed PHPDoc snippet after typing `/**`, when text got corrupted.
- Added missing Psalm scalar type annotations.
- Correct order of resolving `@mixin` members ([#777](https://community.devsense.com/d/777)).
- `html` files can be associated with `php` language support.
- `//region`/`//endregion` folding ([#788](https://community.devsense.com/d/788-region-comments-won-t-fold))

### Formatting

- Removing unwanted extra space after `?` token in nullable return type [#752](https://community.devsense.com/d/752-extra-space-after-optional-type)
- Fixes in **Wordpress** code style
  - Types and function declarations have do not place a open brace `{` on a new line
  - `Unset` calls weren't formatted with spaces within parentheses.
  - `exit()` or `die()` do not have a space within parentheses.
- `php.format.rules.alignConsecutiveAssignments` stopped the formatter in certain cases.
- Using not equal operator `<>` instead of `!=` stopped the formatter.
- Optional comma in constructor header in property promotion stopped the formatter.
- Certain situations when combining HTML and PHP stopped the formatter.
- When `case` inside `switch` was followed by `;` instead of `:` stopped the formatter.

## 1.27.12010 (January 9, 2023)

### Doc Comment Syntaxes

We've been working on recognizing the whole range of commonly used type syntaxes in Doc Blocks; now supporting the most of PHPStan, and other popular linting frameworks.

This release introduces more compatibility, and more features towards Doc Blocks, and related type analysis and code diagnostics.

### Colorization and Semantic Tokens

PHP Doc Comments are getting very complex, and frameworks like PHPStan add even more syntaxes and complexity. We're supporting most of the extended syntax, including generic types, templates, type aliases, unions, intersections, `callable` syntax, and array shapes; and in this release, those types in _documentary comments_ are colorized accordingly.

![php callable specification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/callable-type-def.png)

The whole type expression is now parsed, colorized, and recognized. The tooltip shows the signature help displaying the `Closure`s arguments and return types.

_Note:_ a nicer tooltip is in progress!

### PHPStan Array Shape, `callable`, `list`, and more

Since this release, the editor supports all the syntaxes for array shapes and callables. In addition, the type analysis handles specified PHPStan types accordingly.

PHPStan and Psalm  **array shapes** specified in PHP Doc Comments are allowed, parsed, colorized, and used in code completion and type analysis.

Additionally, `list` and `non-empty-list` types are handled as well. Including their generic counterparts with `<` and `>` types specified.

All the **callable** syntaxes in PHP Doc Comments are supported now as well.

### More Generic Annotations

This update brings the standard types annotated with generic template types; this is especially helpful in Laravel and Symfony frameworks, where it provides type inferring for all the collections, iterables, `Generator`, `DOMNodeList`, etc.

This improves value inferred within `foreach` for all kinds of iterables.

### Doc Comment Snippet for Variables

When creating a Doc Block above variable assignment, or above a global variable, you can now configure the snippet that will be created. Additionally, the snippet setting has a new property `"singleline": true|false` (for variables it's `true` by default) allowing you to specify whether to create the Doc Block single-lined (i.e. `/** @var Type */`).

Sample setting:

```json
{
    "php.docblock.variableSnippet": {
        "singleline": false
    }
}
```

### Fixes

- `integer`, `boolean`, `list` types are handled properly in Doc Block.
- Unused `use` analysis fixed, so it handles type names specified in Doc Blocks.
- Diagnostic and parameter completion for `session_set_cookie_params()` works for both possible definitions.
- Missing `Imagick` constants added.
- Improves type inferring for generic types and various edge cases.

## 1.26.11866 (January 3, 2023)

### IntelliSense &amp; Enums

The PHP 8.1 `enum` objects implicitly implements `UnitEnum` and `BackedEnum` interfaces. The `BackedEnum<TValue>` interface is annotated with a template type argument so it can be used in Doc Comments with the backed type for better type analysis. E.g.:

```php
/** @param \BackedEnum<string> $e */
function foo($e) {
    return $e->value // -> string
}

enum MyEnum : string {
    case A;
}

foo( MyEnum::A );
```

**Generic Types &amp; Doc Comments Type Annotations**

The type annotations in PHP Doc Comments have been reimplemented, so even complex constructs are handled, can be completed, refactored, highlighted, and previewed. Highlighting occurences works even in nested generic types, as well as rename refactoring and code completion.

```php
/**
 * @template TElement of \BackedEnum<string>
 * @return (Collection<int, TElement>|array<int, TElement>)[] Complex generic type annotations */
```

**Multi-Lined Structured Array Types**

This release adds support for multi-lined structured array type annotations. This allows users to specify array type with its keys and corresponding entries types. See the exmaple below:

```php
/**
 * @return array
 *         {
 *           name: string,
 *           age: int,
 *         }
 */
```

### Code Diagnostics Improvements

We're constantly working on improving the code analysis and related diagnostics. This release avoids a lot of falsy warnings.

### Formatting

We're happy to introduce new **Laravel** code style. You just need set `php.format.codestyle` to `laravel`. 

Now you can also let formatter to auto-align consecutive assignments with `php.format.rules.alignConsecutiveAssignments` option [#692](https://community.devsense.com/d/692-sug-formatting-add-auto-align-option).

```php
$a     = 1;
$bbb   = 2;
$ccccc = 3;
```

And other formatting rules we've added are:

|Setting|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|`php.format.rules.spaceBeforeColonInControflowStatements`|Insert a space before colon in control flow blocks.|
|`php.format.rules.spaceBeforeColonInReturnType`|Insert a space before colon in a return type.|
|`php.format.rules.spaceWithinCallParens`|Insert a space within method, function and constructor call parentheses.|
|`php.format.rules.spaceWithinDeclParens`| Insert a space within method, function and constructor declaration parentheses. |
|`php.format.rules.spaceWithinArrayInitilizersParens`|Insert a space within array initializer parentheses.|
|`php.format.rules.spaceWithinIfParens`|Insert a space within `if` statement header parentheses.|
|`php.format.rules.spaceWithinWhileParens`|Insert a space within `while` statement header parentheses.|
|`php.format.rules.spaceWithinForParens`|PInsert a space within `for` statement header parentheses.|
|`php.format.rules.spaceWithinForeachParens`|Insert a space within `foreach` statement header parentheses.|
|`php.format.rules.spaceWithinSwitchParens`|Insert a space within `switch` statement header parentheses.|
|`php.format.rules.spaceWithinCatchParens`|Insert a space within `catch` statement header parentheses.|
|`php.format.rules.spaceWithinBrackets`|Insert a space within brackets.|
|`php.format.rules.spaceWithinBracketsAroundExpression`|Insert a space within brackets around expression.|
|`php.format.rules.spaceWithinExpressionParens`|Insert a space within parentheses around expression.|

We've also fixed some formatting issues:
- `readonly` in namespace caused formatter to stop formatting
- `readonly` and `enum` in function declaration doesn't add space before paren
- PHP 8.2 Disjunctive Normal Form Types are supported now
- Constant uses were double indented in multi-line expressions [#748](https://community.devsense.com/d/748-constant-arrays-are-being-double-indented)
- We've address some cases when combing html and php code didn't result in neat looking code. Most notably in **Wordpress** templates.

### Fixes

Hot fix for built-in PHP functions type analysis.

## 1.26.11753 (December 28, 2022)

### Type Analysis Improvements

- Expression in the `assert()` language construct is used to determine variables type now. ([#744](https://community.devsense.com/d/744-support-assert-to-determine-type))
- Certain type annotations are now more precise.
- Implicit closure variables inside arrow functions are now properly initialized. This fixes falsy warnings about uninitialized variables use inside nested arrow functions.
- More Core types have been annotated with template type arguments, allowing for better inferring of types where `@template` and similar are used ([#746](https://community.devsense.com/d/746)).
- Support for generics has been improved to properly handle doctrine/collections and other templated types using extended `@template` syntax ([#746](https://community.devsense.com/d/746)).

### Editor Improvements

- `readonly` and `enum` keywords are not incorrectly reported as a syntax error, when used as a part of namespace or a function declaration.
- The language server is allocating significantly less memory during code completion; this improves the overall performance.

### Formatting

- In **Wordpress** code style we are no longer inserting space between parentheses and brackets when empty e.g `foo()`, but `foo( 1, 2 )`.
- Not aligning array initializers key value pairs when they are not on separate line (when `php.format.rules.arrayInitializersAlignKeyValuePairs` enabled).
- Fixes incorrect outdenting of constants in multiline expressions.

### Apple Silicon

Introducing the support for Apple **M1** and **M2** chips (**Apple Silicon**). These CPU's with `arm64-x64` architecture were not fully supported in previous release and we're happy to provide the language server for those architectures now.

## 1.25.11652 (December 21, 2022)

### PHP 8.2

Built-in IntelliSense has been updated to provide the latest PHP 8.2 classes, functions, constants, and documentation in all the available languages ([#215](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/215)).

As a part of PHP 8.2, we have added integrated multi-language documentation for the new `Random` extension.

### Formatting

One of the feedbacks we got more often was that sometimes formatting was slow. We've addressed these cases, and it should be much better now. But please let us know if you run into a case when it's not fast.

We're also happy to introduce **Wordpress** code style. You just need set `php.format.codestyle` to `wordpress`. Though there are still a couple of rules for us to implement, it's mostly ready.

In this release, we've also focused on code formatting of mixed html/css/js/php. This one is tricky since the indentation of html code is influencing the php code and vice versa [#171](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/171). We think we got it right now, so hopefully **wordpress templates** will look good when formatted.

### Fixes

- On the first format request, directly after VSCode was first started, only php code was formatted.
- HTML matching tag should get highlighted regardless if it has a php tag inside. [#172](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/172)
- Wrapping of function arguments list with trailing comma, stoped the formatter.
- Incorrect indentation of function calls prefixed with namespace backslash.
- Unwanted spaces inserted into php code in javascript. [#222](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/222)
- When formatting, indentation of php code determined by a position of open tags might have been incorrect. The formatter needed a second pass to get it right.
- Code diagnostics fixes:
  - `parent::` not reported as static call in some cases.
  - Local variables in nested arrow functions not reported as uninitialized.
  - Inheriting `@param` type from base classes, if there is no Doc Comment.
  - Removed support for old `@param` syntax [#740](https://community.devsense.com/d/740).
  - Fixes control flow analysis of nested binary expressions.
  - Added support for alternative Doc Comment array syntax, i.e. `(int|string)[]`.
  - Fixed type analysis for more complex generic types inheritance.
  - Added support for generic `IteratorAggregate<TValue>`.
  - Generic types are properly propagated and substituted in tool-tips.

## 1.25.11537 (December 11, 2022)

### Hover Tool-Tip Improvements

Newly, the mouse hover tool-tip shows **descriptions of parameters**. This behavior can be changed using the setting `"php.hover.parameters"`.

The documentation link the muse hover tool-tip can be enabled or disabled using the new setting `"php.hover.documentation"`.

### Generics

The template type inferring and substitution has been improved to handle more complex type hierarchies. ([#723](https://community.devsense.com/d/723), [#733](https://community.devsense.com/d/733), [#731](https://community.devsense.com/d/731))

### Fixes

- Generated **Doc Comment** respects `yield` and correctly annotates function with `Generator` type hint. Additionally, the code diagnostics respect function returning `Generator` and correctly analyzes the return value type.

- `'enum'` keyword is a little hack in the PHP itself. We have fixed how it is parsed so it respects the PHP 5, 7, 8, and 8.1 onwards conrrectly ([#205](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/205)).

- Autocompletion of parenthesis `()` is inserted ust once when generating automatic function override ([#730](https://community.devsense.com/d/730))

- _Go to Definition_ has been fixed.

### Formatting

#### New customization settings

As promised, we are adding more formatting options based on your feedback.

|Setting|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|`php.format.rules.spaceBeforeParenthesesInArrowFunctions`|Space before parentheses in arrow functions|
|`php.format.rules.spaceAroundConcatenation`|Space around concatenation `.`|
|`php.format.rules.spaceAfterUnaryNot`|Space after unary not `!`|
|`php.format.rules.groupUseWrap`| Defines wrapping behavior of group use |
|`php.format.rules.groupUseNewLineBeforeFirstDeclaration`|Place a new line before first group use declaration|


#### `foreach`

We are compacting `foreach` statement headers into a one line by default now (as defined in `PSR-12`).

```php
<?php 
foreach ($iterable as $key => $value) {
}
```

#### `PSR-12`

We've slightly improved `PSR-12` code style. Now we are automatically wrapping multiline group use declarations as specified in the standard.

```php
<?php
use Vendor\Package\SomeNamespace\{
    SubnamespaceOne\ClassA,
    SubnamespaceOne\ClassB,
    SubnamespaceTwo\ClassY,
    ClassZ,
};
```

#### Fixes

- When anonymous class implements list was defined on multiple lines, we didn't indent them correctly
- Implements list wrapping settings work for anonymous classes too

## 1.24.11420 (December 1, 2022)

### Array Shapes

The editor treats inline array shapes specified in Doc Comments now. The following syntax is correct, and understood by the PHP editor:

```php
<?php

/**
 * @param array{ name: string, id: int, data: \App\Model\User } $a The entity.
 */
function foo($a) { .. }
```

Array shapes improve your code completion, as it provides code completion for array keys; and inferred types, as it resolves the array items type according to the specified index.

### IntelliSense Improvements

**Prentheses Completion**

Newly, IntelliSense completes parentheses when completing a function. The keyboard cursor is placed in between them. Optionally, the feature can be either disabled, or the complete function signature can be completed as a snippet. This allows jumping between parameters with `[tab]` key and fill-in the arguments.

The feature is configurable through the setting `"php.completion.parameters"`. By default, it is set to `"parentheses"` so it completes just the parentheses `()`.

![php complete parentheses](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/vsc-complete-parentheses.gif)

**Xdebug stubs**

We have added stubs for **Xdebug** extension. Go to settings, and add `"xdebug"` to the `"php.stubs"` setting:

```json
{ "php.stubs": ["*", "xdebug"] }
```

This adds _Xdebug_ functions to IntelliSense, code diagnostics, and improves the type inferring analysis.

**Deprecation Messages**

Whenever a deprecated symbol is used, it is striked out and the corresponding warning is shown. Additionally, in this release, we're adding the deprecation message to the code completion tool-tip.

![php deprecation message](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/vsc-deprecated-message.png)

Note, to mark your function as deprecated, add the `@deprecated` Doc Comment tag as it is below:

```php
/** @deprecated Do not use this, since version 1.2.3 it is not maintaned anymore! */
function getEntity(array $row) : object { ... }
```

### Customizable Formatter

Many companies have coding guidelines when creating source code which might differ from our predefined code styles. We're happy to introduce highly customizable formatter and we begin with around `30` different code formatting options. This is just a begining and we're accepting suggestions which options to prioritize next.

These more granular code formatting options are only available for `PREMIUM` users, but Community version users can still influence formatting with `php.format.codestyle` option.

For example you can let formatter to auto-align key value pairs in array initializers with `php.format.rules.arrayInitializersAlignKeyValuePairs` option [#692](https://community.devsense.com/d/692-sug-formatting-add-auto-align-option).

```php
$x = [
    1    => 'foo',
    1234 => 'bar'
];
```

Or if you and your company prefer `Whitesmiths` style you can set that up by setting `php.format.codestyle` to `allman` and `php.format.rules.indentBraces` to `true` [#689](https://community.devsense.com/d/689-whitesmiths-style-sometimes-termed-wishart-style).

```php
function foo()
    {
    echo "Hello";
    }
```

In general use `php.format.rules.*` settings to configure the formatter to behave as you wish. For a detailed list of formatting options, either open the Settings Editor (`Ctrl+,`) and type `php format` in the Search bar or see our [documentation page](https://docs.devsense.com/vscode/editor/customize-formatting).

### Format on Type

We've reimplemented how format on type behaves. Now it correctly picks up what part of the code you are editing and formats it when you type `;` or `}`. This way your code always stays correctly formatted without a need to explicitly call the formatting command.

We recommend to turn this feature on. By default in VS Code it's disabled.

If you'd like to turn it on just for PHP you can do it in `settings.json` like this:

```json
"[php]": {
  "editor.formatOnType": true
}
```

### Formatting Fixes

- Functions with multiple parameters that also contained `func_get_args` or `funct_num_args` in the body stopped the formatter.
- Multiline use traits statement were double indented.
- Indentation fix of lambda functions nested in certain statement headers.
- Fixes indenation of chained method calls when part of the chain is a field. [#715](https://community.devsense.com/d/715-if-expression-without-braces-indents)
- Correctly indents arguments of static method calls spread across multiple lines.
- Fixes indentation of multiline field uses, including static fields or constants.
- Null-safe operator is supported.
- Attributes are supported.

### IntelliSense Fixes

**Control Flow**

We have fixed the control flow analysis, when there are functions that never return (i.e. they throw an exception instead of returning a value). Correspondingly, false warnings about unreachable code were fixed, and corresponding variables type inferring as well.

**Trailing Comma in Lambda `use ()`**

The issue with unsupported trailing comma in lambda declaration has been fixed ([#207](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/207)).

**Blade**

We have fixed use of `@can`, `@endcan`, `@forelse`, and `@empty` inside `.blade.php` files.

**`"php.stubs"`**

The configuration setting `"php.stubs"` has been fixed. It was not working after reloading a workspace.

## 1.23.11234 (November 10, 2022)

### `launch.json` with `"envfile"` Option

Newly, you can specify your `.env` file to be used by the built-in PHP server. This is important especially when developing a **Laravel** application! An example launch configuration would look like the following:

```json
{
    "name": "Start Built-in Server with .env",
    "type": "php",
    "request": "launch",
    "runtimeArgs": ["-S", "localhost:8888", "-t", "public"],
    "envfile": ".env"
}
```

### Doc Comment Generator

The generated PHP Doc has been improved. It specifies `@var` above properties and class constants if possible. Additionally, if the function is recognized as it **never** returns, it annotates the return type as `@return never` ([#193](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/193)).

### Quick Fixes

The quick fix for getters and setters follows `PSR-12` now. Additionally, it specifies a type hint in the correct form.

Quick fix for generating `__construct()` ([#198](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/198)) generates Doc Comment in the correct form now. Then generated function complies with PSR-12 now as well.

Also the quick fix for implementing an interface has been updated to follow PSR-12 and to generate type names correctly.

### PHP 8.2

The remaining PHP 8.2 features are being supported by PHP Editor.

- Newly, the special attribute `#[SensitiveParameter]` is included in code completion.
- Also, `enum` case values can be used in constant expressions, as specified in RFC.

### Formatting

#### `PSR-12`

There are couple more rules we are introducing for `PSR-12` code style in this version. Particularly they instruct the formatter on how to behave when formatting control statement headers which are spread across multiple lines.

e.g. 
```php
for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++
    ) {
    // for body
}
```

gets formatted to:

```php
for (
    $i = 0;
    $i < 10;
    $i++
) {
    // for body
}
```

In a same way when list of `implements` is split across multiple lines, we put first item on the next line and each interface on a separete line.

Now, when wrapping function or method calls we also consider what kind of arguments are used. When a single argument is split into multiple lines, such as array or lambda function, we do not consider this as a reason to split the argument list. (This behaviour is according to [PSR12 specification](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/#47-method-and-function-calls))

```php
<?php

somefunction($foo, $bar, [
  // ...
], $baz);

$app->get('/hello/{name}', function ($name) use ($app) {
    return 'Hello ' . $app->escape($name);
});
```

#### Format Selection

We've improved how format selection is working, which will also affect when `editor.formatOnType` and `editor.formatOnPaste` is enabled.

#### Fixes

We've also fixed an issue when Javascript formatter was adding spaces into php code [#203](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/203)
and HTML formatter editing contents of php code. This mainly manifestated when `editor.formatOnPaste` option was enabled.

The next, we've addressed some formatting issues as well:
  - Constructor closing `)` was sometimes indented incorrectly when statement was multiline.
  - In certain cases comments were indented incorrectly.
  - Method calls on single line shouldn't wrap. [#693](https://community.devsense.com/d/693-sug-formatting-don-t-wrap-when-there-is-no-data-in-brackets)
  - Functions with `func_get_args` or `funct_num_args` in the body stopped the formatter. [#691](https://community.devsense.com/d/691-bug-formatting-not-working-when-there-are-specific-functions)
  - Only multi-line comments begining with `*` are indented + 1.
  - Sometimes unnecesary new line was added after array initializer.
  - lambdas weren't pushed to the new line when containing element was wrapped
  - fix of double indentation when constructor was present in multiline array
  - Array with multiple lambdas indentation bug. [#702](https://community.devsense.com/d/702-code-format-array-with-multiple-anonymous-functions)
  - Parenthesis expressions weren't indented. [#700](https://community.devsense.com/d/700-code-format-if-condition-with-braces)
  - Multi-line use traits statement is properly indented now.
  - In certain cases new lines after the optional return type were collapsed. [#704](https://community.devsense.com/d/704-code-format-abstract-function)

## 1.22.11089 (October 31, 2022)

### PSR-12 Formatting

We are happy to announce an introduction **PSR-12** code style. With the previous releases we've mostly covered all the important rules necessary for PSR-12 compilent formatter. There are some minor things we are still going to improve, but we are mostly there. We are also switching the default formatting code style from old PSR-2 and from now on, it's going to be PSR-12.

![PSR-12 code style](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/psr-12.png)

To be complient we've also added these rules:
 - Adding space between exception types in `catch (OtherThrowableType | AnotherThrowableType $e)`
 - Compacting whitespaces in function declaration header so the return type is on the same line as `)` parenthesis

Being complient with `PSR-12` is important, but how the code looks after the formatting is too. And we are continuing to work on beauty part as well. One case we've done for this release is how array initializers are threated. When there is an new line anywhere in the array then we put all the array items on a new line and indent. [#683](https://community.devsense.com/d/683-code-format-array-new-line).

![Array initializer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/array_initializers.gif)

In similar way, we are applying the analogous behaviour for call parameters and function/method declarations, but only in `PSR-12` code style.

We've also fixed some minor formatting issues.

### Composer Improvements

`create-project` command has been updated. Now it opens the Open Folder dialog if it's not clear where you'd like to create the new project. At the end, it opens the newly created project in VS Code.

### New Code Diagnostics

Newly, invalid declaration of properties inside interfaces is reported. ([#174](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/174))

Also, the code analysis handles the default **Laravel** class aliases. This affects IntelliSense and avoids false code warnings.

See the **Fixes** below for more updates.

### Fixes

Code Diagnostics are less strict about type juggling (`int` -> `float` type juggle in `for` loops), and also it handles better array element type inferring ([#185](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/185)).

Then we have fixed code diagnostic of functions, that use variable amount of arguments through `func_get_args()`. ([#677](https://community.devsense.com/d/677-problem-with-func-get-args-and-phpdoc/5))

Also there were issues when problems and IntelliSense did not get updated after composer packages being removed or updated - we've make changes that avoids that, and everything gets updated seamlessly as it should. ([#182](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/182))

## 1.21.10985 (October 23, 2022)

### `@var` above function parameters

Editor handles Documentary blocks right above function parameter definition. If there is a `@var` with type specification, it is used for the parameter type across IntelliSense, tool-tips, and code diagnostics.

```php
class MyClass {
    function __construct(
        /** @var T[] */
        public readonly $list, // $list is of type T[]
    ) { }
}
```

### Formatting

How it looks is important. So we continue our effort to make it beautiful:

 - Indent level is incresed in multi-line expressions when accessing a property or calling a method [#530](https://community.devsense.com/d/530-formatting-keep-braces-in-the-same-line/18)
 - We are indenting code in PHP tags in all the code styles. [#173](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/173)
 - In certain cases when HTML was combined with PHP unexpected new lines were added [#173](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/173#issuecomment-1280021048)
 - PHP Close tags `?>` are indented according to the previous `<?php` open tag

 ### Improvements

 #### PHPUnit Test View

 This update improves resolving of PHPUnit tests in _Test View_ panel. Processing test files is faster, avoiding redundant read and parse from disk. Also, the test view now supports tests from inherited classes ([#678](https://community.devsense.com/d/678-phpunit-test-explorer-ignores-tests-inside-abstract-parent-testcase-class)).
 
## 1.20.10937 (October 19, 2022)

### Editor Improvements

#### Highlighting Control Structures

Highlighting occurrences of control structures and corresponding keywords has been added. Newly the editor highlights control structures such as `for`, `foreach`, `while`, or `do`, with the corresponding `continue`, or `break`, when you navigate the caret on them. Also, all `return`s are highlighted in the function, and `case`s with `default` label.

It also highlights matching pairs of `switch`/`endswitch`, `if`/`elseif`/`endif`, `try`/`catch`/`finally`, and others.

![highlight if/elseif/endif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/highlight-control-structure.png)

#### Fuzzy Search Symbol in Workspace

Searching through the workspace supports fuzzy queries; i.e. the symbol names are matched against letters in the query. Additionally, searching using upper-case letter is case-sensitive, so you can quickly search for camel-cased notation.

![fuzzy search symbols in worksspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/fuzzy-search.gif)

#### Formatting

We are improving formatting support with more cases. 

- The cast operators are separated with a space now. ([#175](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/175)).
- Constructor property promotion is formatted correctly. [#176](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/176)
- Unwanted space was added after `::class` in certain cases. [#530](https://community.devsense.com/d/530-formatting-keep-braces-in-the-same-line/26)
- `else` or `elseif` is placed on a new line when goes after a statement. [#530](https://community.devsense.com/d/530-formatting-keep-braces-in-the-same-line/25)
- When type reference is separated from the `?` with one space if it's part of the ternary operator. [#530](https://community.devsense.com/d/530-formatting-keep-braces-in-the-same-line/19)

### Diagnostic Improvements

#### New setting `"php.problems.scope": "opened"`

Newly you can only diagnose PHP files that are opened in the editor. Note, parse errors will be still reported across the entire workspace.

Set the setting `"php.problems.scope": "opened"` to see how it works.

#### Check for too many args

Now we check for use of `func_get_args`, `func_get_arg`, or `func_num_args` so functions with variable number of arguments are detected, and _too_many_args_ warning is not reported.

## 1.19.10893 (October 16, 2022)

### New Formatter

We have redesigned and updated the built-in PHP code formatter. It provides several new formatting styles through the setting `"php.format.codeStyle"`.

#### **`Allman`**

The `Allman` style is named after Eric Allman. This style puts the braces on the next line. This applies to all control statements and declarations.

```php
while ($x == $y)
{
    foo();
}
```

#### **`K&R`**

The `K&R` style (Kernighan & Ritchie Style) keeps open braces on the same line for control structures, types, functions and methods.

```php
while ($x == $y) {
    foo();
}
```

You can still keep using previously supported code styles:

- `"PSR-2"` style,
- Visual Studio-like style called `"PHP Tools"`,
- and `"Off"`,

The formatter works with HTML/JS/CSS, formats ranges, formats whole documents, and formats on typing - after closing a block of code or a statement.

![Formatting multi-line expression](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/format-document.gif)

#### Formatting Fixes

The following is the list of formatting issues we have fixed and implemented:

- Arrow function formatting fixes.
- Formatting supports nested function calls.
- Fixes of formatting enumerations.
- Fixes of formatting related to `match` expressions.
- *Heredoc* and *Nowdoc* expressions are left untouched during formatting.
- Formatting correctly indents grouped `use` statements.
- Indent multi-line control statements headers.
- Multi-line expressions inside lambdas are indented.
- Empty blocks with comments are indented.
- Group `use` statements and `match` expressions respect optional trailing comma.
- Space between type and ampersand `type &$x` when formatting function parameters.
- Indenting empty blocks with comments.
- Multi-line expressions inside anonymous types are indented.
- Multi-line function and method calls are correctly indented.
- Parenthesis of function or method headers on a new line are not indented.
- Fix of an incorrect new line after a lambda expression.
- Formatting leaves single-line php blocks.
- Close tag is always separated from the previous token.
- Function named arguments are formatted.
- Anonymous classes have space before `{` if kept on the same line as a class header.
- Fixed formatting of PHP code in HTML attributes (e.g. `<div style="<?php echo "something" ?>">`). The formatter won't add additional white-spaces anymore.

### Highlighting To-Do Comments

Newly the editor highlights to-do annotations in your code. This helps to keep track of unfinished work and pending issues.

![highlight todo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/highlight-todo.png)

You can customize the style using the following setting:

```json
"php.highlight-todo.style" : {
    "backgroundColor": "#ec0"
}
```

Or you can turn the feature off completely with the setting `"php.highlight-todo.enable": false`.

### Debugger Code Completion

During debugging, when typing into a _Debug Console_, names of existing local variables will be suggested. Type `$` or the completion shortcut (by default `Ctrl`+`Space`), and available local variables will be suggested.

![debugger code completion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/vsc-debug-completion.gif)

### New Diagnostics

The editor checks and reports the following diagnostics:

- Calling instance methods statically. ([#641](https://community.devsense.com/d/641-static-call-to-instance-method-not-detected))
- Invalid assignments to type properties. ([#647](https://community.devsense.com/d/647-assigning-wrong-types-is-not-detected))
- Too many arguments provided to a function call. ([#645](https://community.devsense.com/d/645-wrong-number-of-function-call-arguments-not-detected))
- Allows objects to be used for constants, and handles use of Doc Comment with `@var` above `const`.

### New Settings

We have added a new setting `"php.problems.excludeGitIgnore"` ([#169](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/169)) which simply lets you to ignore code diagnostics in files/folders specified in workspace's `.gitignore`s.

### Fixes

- Code action for generating `__construct()` respects text editor tabs and spaces setting.
- Generating Doc Comment (`/**`) respects the indentation.
- Generating Doc Comment above function respects customized Doc Comment snippet (`php.docblock.functionSnippet` setting).
- Fixes some cases, when IntelliSense was not updated after adding Composer packages.

## 1.18.10692 (September 30, 2022)

### Profiler Support 🔥

PHP code profiling allows you to inspect how much time and how many calls were made to every single function in the code.

[Read more (docs.devsense.com) ...](https://docs.devsense.com/vscode/profiling)

**We have added support for Xdebug profiling!** Xdebug profile files (cachegrind format) can be opened, viewed, and inspected. The extension also highlights hot paths in your code, according to the profiling results.

**Call Times View:**

![php call times view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/profile-calltimes.png)

**Callers/Callees View**

Detailed view of callers and called functions, including times.

![php callers callees](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/profile-details.png)

**Hot Path Decoration**

Profiling result file is analyzed, and hot paths are highlighted right in the source code:

![profiling hot path decoration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/profile-highlight.png)

### Updated code diagnostics

- Variables used inside arrow functions are not reported as uninitialized now ([#664](https://community.devsense.com/d/664-bug-when-use-use-keyword-inside-arrow-function-inside-anonymous-function)).
- Diagnostics `PHP1408` and `PHP1409` are reported with a lower severity now.

### Open-VSX

The entire extension is now available on [open-vsx.org](https://open-vsx.org/extension/devsense/phptools-vscode)

### Other Improvements

- Auto-imported 'use' is sorted ([#666](https://community.devsense.com/d/666-auto-import-alphabetically)).
- HTML code formatting fixes.
- Fix of constructor property promotion formatting.

## 1.17.10641 (September 26, 2022)

### Introducing **What's New**

We are getting many useful feature requests and feedbacks, and we're trying hard to add as many improvements as we can. One of them was to inform briefly about the news. With this release, we've started showing **What's New** window with the major updates.

The window can be opened manually with command `"PHP Tools: Release Notes"`. Automatic opening after each major update can be disabled with the checkbox at the bottom of the window.

  ![release notes command](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/vsc-open-releasenotes.png)

### Debug

Debugging has a few neat features! More settings for enabling profiling, `var_dump()` produces nicer and more detailed messages, and Xdebug for PHP is determined when debugging starts.

#### Debug `develop` Mode

Since this release, we have enabled `develop` Xdebug mode. This gives nicer looking and more informative `var_dump()` outputs.

In case you prefer the normal-looking `var_dump()` messages, change the `"noDevelop"` setting in the `launch.json` profile.

#### Debug `profile` Mode

You can enable `profile` mode now. Set the `"profile": true` setting in your `launch.json` profile:

```json
{
    "name": "Launch & Profile built-in Server",
    "type": "php",
    "request": "launch",
    "runtimeArgs": ["-S", "localhost:8000", "-t", "."],
    "noDebug": true, // <-- do not initiate debugging
    "profile": true // <-- enable xdebug.mode "profile"
}
```

#### Uncaught Exceptions Filter

Newly, the Debug view provides option to either break or ignore **Uncaught Exceptions**. This options is located in "Debug and Run" view, at "Breakpoints" panel.

### Code Diagnostics

- We have fixed incorrect duplicit key check in case of `enum`' case values. ([#658](https://community.devsense.com/d/658-problem-with-enums-as-keys))
- Fixed return type check when return type hint is `void`.
- Reporting anonymous functions with unused `use` variable.
- Reporting anonymous function' `use` variable is not initialized.
- Reporting of empty namespaces.
- Checking that value from a function returning `void` is being used.
- Reports accessing a property on `void`.
- Checks expressions in string interpolation are convertible to `string`.
- Checks that type of a property is defined.
- The diagnostic for unknown class or unknown function is suppressed if user is opening just a single file, without opening a workspace or folder.
- The diagnostic `0412` severity has been changed to *error*, code `1412` (unassigned variable use).

### Composer

All-in-One **Composer** integration has been added! It implements useful commands for requiring, removing and browsing packages, automatically installing `composer.phar` so you don't have to, adding IntelliSense for `composer.json`, code lenses for running scripts, neat tool-tips for your installed packages, it checks for abandoned packages, and more!

### Other Improvements

There are fixes to the PHP formatter. Formatting wasn't performed when explicit cast was used with less common data type alias, e.g. `(integer)`, `(boolean)`, or `(real)`.

## 1.15.10535 (September 14, 2022)

### Command `PHP: Search todo ...`

Introducing a quick way of browsing through all the to-do comments in PHP code. The command `"PHP: Search todo ..."` opens quick pick with all the to-do. It allows to filter, search through, and navigate to the selected item.

  ![searching to-do in PHP code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/vsc-search-todo.gif)

### Tool-Tips get nicer

Hover tips for function signatures are split into more lines if they would get too long. Also, the optional parameters are not denoted with `[` `]` anymore. ([#159](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/159))

  ![long function tool-tip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/vsc-long-tooltip.png)

Additionally, safe HTML tags in code comments get rendered nicely in a tool-tip now. Having tags like `<br/>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<code>` in your documentary comments is allowed and when displayed in a tool-tip, it gets rendered nicely and formatted.

### Code Diagnostics

We have added more diagnostics, and fixed a few rare cases in code flow analysis.

- There is a diagnostic for invalid use `break;`, when `break` or `continue` are out of the allowed scope.
- Diagnostic of code reachability with `try`/`finally` was fixed.
- Diagnostic of function return has been improved in cases, where there is a type hint `mixed`, but the function does not return anything.

### Other Improvements

There are fixes to internal exceptions, and several performance and memory use optimizations.
